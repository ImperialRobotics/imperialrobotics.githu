Today, the new competition for the 2016-2017 year was introduced today. It is called the Velocity Vortex. Today, the team decided our basic plan for the robot
and determined the point system. We also have a new mentor this year (David Tuck) to assist us on this year's journey. We are excited to participate in this
year's FIRST Tech Challenge. Always remember: Gracious Professionalism!
