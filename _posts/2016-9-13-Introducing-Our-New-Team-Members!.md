Today was our first in school meeting. It was hosted by our mentor Mr. Tuck as part of an outreach program for the
new members of our team. We gained two new members: Maximo Mateo(10th) and Dalia Quezaba(11th). Our team captian, Austin
Davis, inducted these new members by enlightening them with the wonders of robotics. He explained our form of communication
outside of school and taught them what it means to be on a team. It was essential that these new team members learned
that this team was not only just a group of people working together, but also a family that encounters many obstacles
on its way to competition. We finally got confirmation from our principal, Mrs. Huitt, that our team was being 
sponsored by the school to be able to get parts and utensils for this year's competition. The final thing that was done at
this meeting was the division of labor to ensure efficiency when creating the robot. We are excited to get the ball rolling
for this great new year of competition!
