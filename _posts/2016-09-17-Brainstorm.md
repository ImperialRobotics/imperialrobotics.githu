Today was another successful meeting. We decided what point values to target and identified what kind of design to use for our robot.
We were able to build a basic blueprint of our robot. Our sister team, Iron Reign (team 6832), was able to bouce some ideas and
help us out. We hope to begin coding next week once we have everything set up.
